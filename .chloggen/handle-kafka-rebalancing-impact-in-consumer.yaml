# A brief description of the change.  Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: Once a rebalance is triggered, sessions must be completed within `Config.Consumer.Group.Rebalance.Timeout`. This means that ConsumeClaim() functions must exit as quickly as possible to allow time for Cleanup() and the final offset commit. If the timeout is exceeded, the consumer will be removed from the group by Kafka, which will cause offset commit failures. Solved this problem by watching `ConsumerGroupSession.Context().Done()` in `ConsumeClaim`.
